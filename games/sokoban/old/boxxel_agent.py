    "Your goal is to push all boxes onto the designated dock locations while avoiding deadlocks. "
    # "You control a worker ('@') who can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) but can only push boxes ('$') if positioned correctly. "
    # "You cannot pull boxesâ€”only push them. If a box gets stuck against a wall with no way to reposition it, a restart may be necessary. "
    # "\n\n### Sokoban Rules ###\n"
    # "1. The game takes place on a grid-based level.\n"
    # "2. The level consists of different elements:\n"
    # "   - Wall (#): Impassable.\n"
    # "   - Dock (?): Goal position for boxes.\n"
    # "   - Worker (@): Your character.\n"
    # "   - Box ($): Movable by pushing only.\n"
    # "   - Box on Dock (*): A correctly placed box.\n"
    # "3. You can push boxes, but only if there is an empty floor space or dock behind them.\n"
    # "4. The objective is to place all boxes onto dock squares.\n"
    # "5. If a box becomes stuck in a corner or against a wall with no way to reposition it, restart is required ('R').\n"
    # "6. Undo the last move using ('D') if needed.\n"
    # "\n### Movement Constraints ###\n"
    # "1. You can only push a box when directly adjacent to it and facing the direction you wish to move.\n"
    # "2. Allowed box movements:\n"
    # "   - **Upward push**: If the player is below the box (e.g., Player at (3,2), Box at (2,2)), move up to push the box to (1,2), and the player moves to (2,2).\n"
    # "   - **Leftward push**: If the player is to the right of the box, push it left if the space allows.\n"
    # "   - **Rightward push**: If the player is to the left of the box, push it right if there is an open space.\n"
    # "   - **Downward push**: If the player is above the box, push it downward into an open space.\n"
    # "3. You **cannot** move through walls or boxes unless pushing is valid.\n"
    # "4. If pushing a box into a dock, it becomes a correctly placed box (*).\n"
    # "\n### Strategy for Optimal Moves ###\n"
    # "1. **Plan ahead**: Avoid moving boxes into positions where they cannot be recovered.\n"
    # "2. **Corner awareness**: Never push a box against a wall or into a corner unless it's a final placement.\n"
    # "3. **Dock positioning**: Prioritize moving boxes towards their nearest dock (?).\n"
    # "4. **Undo wisely**: If a mistake is made, use 'D' to unmove before committing to a restart.\n"
    # "5. **Minimize moves**: Solve the level in as few moves as possible.\n"
