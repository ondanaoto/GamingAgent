Analyze the current Tetris board state and generate PyAutoGUI code to control the active Tetris piece for the next {plan_seconds} second(s).
An active Tetris piece appears from the top, and is not connected to the bottom of the screen is to be placed.

## Board state reference as a text table:
{board_text}

## General Tetris Controls (example keybinds).
- left: move the piece left by 1 grid unit.
- right: move the piece right by 1 grid unit.
- up: rotate the piece clockwise once by 90 degrees.
- down: accelerated drop (use ONLY IF you are very confident its control won't propagate to the next piece. DO NOT repeat more than 5 times).

## Tetris Geometry
- Tetris pieces in the game follow the following configurations:
{tetris_configurations}
- Every Tetris piece starts at state 0, every rotation will transit the piece to the next state modulo 4.
- Consider each Tetris piece occupies its nearest 3x3 grid (or 4x4 for I-shape). Each configurable specifies which grid unit are occupied by each rotation state.
- Place each piece such that the flat sides align with the sides or geometric structure at the bottom.

## Game Physics
- The game is played on a 10x20 grid.
- Blocks fall at a rate of approximately 1 grid unit every 3 seconds.
- Pressing the down key moves the block down by 1 grid unit.
- Rotations will be performed within the nearest 9x9 block, and shapes will be changed accordingly.

## Planning

### Principles
- Maximize Cleared Lines: prioritize moves that clear the most rows.
- Minimize Holes: avoid placements that create empty spaces that can only be filled by future pieces.
- Minimize Bumpiness: keep the playfield as flat as possible to avoid difficult-to-fill gaps.
- Minimize Aggregate Height: lower the total height of all columns to delay top-outs.
- Minimize Maximum Height: prevent any single column from growing too tall, which can lead to an early game over.

### Strategies
- Try clear the bottom-most line first.
- Imagine what shape the entire structure will form after the current active piece is placed. Avoid leaving any holes.
- Do not move a block piece back and forth. Plan a trajectory and generate the code.

### Code generation and latency
- In generated code, only consider the current block.
- At the time the code is executed, 3~5 seconds have elapsed.
- The entire sequence of key presses should be feasible within {plan_seconds} second(s).

### Lessons learned
{experience_summary}

## Output Format:
- Output ONLY the Python code for PyAutoGUI commands, e.g. `pyautogui.press("left")`.
- Include brief comments for each action.
- Do not print anything else besides these Python commands.
